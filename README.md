## User Authentication

For user authentication, the app uses the data obtained from the API. The structure of the user object is as follows:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "gender": "male",
  "employmentStatus": "Full-Time"
  // ... other user properties
}

Username: The user's first name is used as the username.
Password: The user's email address is used as the password.
When logging in, the app checks for a match between the entered username (first name) and password (email) with the data obtained from the API.
